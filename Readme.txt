Alright enough of styling with just html tags... Lets start styling with css... Before that let us get acquinted with the most famous html tags..
span
div

Also to work with inline-css you need to know an important attribute... Before that attributes??

Attributes are like features or specifications to an element. For eg: 
If a girl is an element, then her boobs is an attribute and (big, small) is value for that attribute..

Similarly style is an attribute and it can have many values out of which background-color:<color> is a value
We will explore more css styles later.
Getting to the task now... Open index.html

and replace the content inside body tag with

		<div> This is a div. </div>
		<div style='background-color: red;'>This is a div with style attribute.</div>
